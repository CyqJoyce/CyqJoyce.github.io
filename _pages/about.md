Hello,everyone!Welcome and thank you for visiting my site!My name is Cao Yongqian, I am 22 years old, from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, and I studied broadcasting and hosting art at Hohai University. 

Outside of academia, I began my journey in Chinese dance at the age of 5, and in 2021 I was in a dance that was performed at the Jiangsu Grand Theater. I also have a passion for the piano, and to this day, I still play my favorite songs.
